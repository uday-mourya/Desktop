            Sports is an extremely important component for the overall development of our nation. India, in the last
            few years has made steady progress in the field of sports. This tremendous potential needs to be
            showcased at a global platform. It’s time we inspire young talent, give them top-notch infrastructure
            and training of the highest level. We need to inculcate a strong spirit of participation in sports that
            enables players to demonstrate their true potential. Only then can India realise its dream of becoming a
            sports super power.
